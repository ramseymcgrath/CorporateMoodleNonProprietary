Diff-Match-Patch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yetanotherape/diff-match-patch.png)](https://travis-ci.org/yetanotherape/diff-match-patch)
================
The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the operations required for synchronizing plain text:

* computes character-based diff of two texts
* performs fuzzy match of given string
* applies patches onto changed base text.

This is the port of [google-diff-match-patch](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) lib to PHP.

**NOTE: This is alpha software and is under development.**

Diff
----
Compare two plain text and efficiently return a array of differences. It works with characters, but if you want to compute word-based or line-based diff â€” you can easily [tune](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/LineOrWordDiffs) it for your needs.

Usage:
```php
<?php

use DiffMatchPatch\DiffMatchPatch;

$text1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
$text2 = "That quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog.";
$dmp = new DiffMatchPatch();
$diffs = $dmp->diff_main($text1, $text2, false);
var_dump($diffs);
```
Returns:
```php
array(
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_EQUAL, "Th"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_DELETE, "e"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_INSERT, "at"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_EQUAL, " quick brown fox jump"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_DELETE, "s"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_INSERT, "ed"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_EQUAL, " over "),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_DELETE, "the"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_INSERT, "a"),
    array(DiffMatchPatch::DIFF_EQUAL, " lazy dog."),
)
```

Match
-----
Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a plain text near the given location. Weighted for both accuracy and location.

Usage:
```php
<?php

use DiffMatchPatch\DiffMatchPatch;

$dmp = new DiffMatchPatch();
$text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox.";
$pos = $dmp->match_main($text, "fox", 0); // Returns 16
$pos = $dmp->match_main($text, "fox", 40); // Returns 40
$pos = $dmp->match_main($text, "jmps"); // Returns 20
$pos = $dmp->match_main($text, "jmped"); // Returns -1
$pos = $dmp->Match_Threshold = 0.7;
$pos = $dmp->match_main($text, "jmped"); // Returns 20
```

Patch
-----
Apply a list of patches in [Unidiff-like format](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/Unidiff) onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.

Usage:
```php
<?php

use DiffMatchPatch\DiffMatchPatch;

$dmp = new DiffMatchPatch();
$patches = $dmp->patch_make("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", "That quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog.");
// @@ -1,11 +1,12 @@
//  Th
// -e
// +at
//   quick b
// @@ -22,18 +22,17 @@
//  jump
// -s
// +ed
//   over
// -the
// +a
//   laz
$result = $dmp->patch_apply($patches, "The quick red rabbit jumps over the tired tiger.");
var_dump($diffs);
```
Returns:
```php
array(
    "That quick red rabbit jumped over a tired tiger.",
    array (
        true,
        true,
    ),
);
```

API
---
Currently this lib available in PHP, Java, JavaScript, Dart, C++, C#, Objective C, Lua and Python. Regardless of language, each library features the same [API](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/API) and the same functionality. All versions also have comprehensive test harnesses.

Algorithms
----------
This library implements [Myer's diff algorithm](http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/myers.pdf) which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of [pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups](http://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/) surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.

This library also implements a [Bitap matching algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm) at the heart of a flexible [matching and patching strategy](http://neil.fraser.name/writing/patch/).

Requirements
------------
* PHP 5.3+
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
